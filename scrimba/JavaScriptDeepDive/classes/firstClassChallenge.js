// 1. A school's film club wants to store details of the films it has studied so far this year. Create a new class to do this. We want to store the following data about each film: id, title, director, releaseYear and genres.

// 2. Create two methods on the class: one for adding multiple genres to the films - addGenre(genre) - and one to get the title of the film - getFilmTitle().

// 3. Instantiate a new instance of the class using data from your your favourite film. Add at least 1 genre to your film using addGenre(), and get the title using getFilmTitle()

// Beginning:
class Film {
    constructor(id, title, director, releaseYear, genres = []) {
        this.id = id;
        this.title = title;
        this.director = director;
        this.releaseYear = releaseYear;
        this.genres = genres;
    }
    addGenre(genre){
        this.genres = [...this.genres, genre];
    }
    getFilmTitle(){
        return `Film Title: ${this.title}`;
    }
}
const favoriteFilm = new Film(1, 'Somos', 'Some Director', 2020);
favoriteFilm.addGenre('Action');
console.log(favoriteFilm.getFilmTitle()); // Output: Film Title: Somos
